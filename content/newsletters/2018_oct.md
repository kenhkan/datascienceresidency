Linear Regression is the oldest, simple and widely used supervised machine learning algorithm for predictive analysis. It is the bread and butter of data science, so we felt we need to remind you that it’s always best to master the basics first! In this post, [Yoel Zeldes](https://medium.com/@yoelzeldes) talks about how headsf used linear regression for his data science interview home assignment. Even if you know linear regression inside out, it is still good to review this post and ensure you remember all the assumptions made, how to isdjfhaksjdfhjkasdfadfmplement and evaluate it and how to interpret the results.
