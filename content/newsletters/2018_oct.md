# Why joining Data Science Residency?

![Data Science](/img/data_science.jpeg "Data Science")

Breaking into data science, you think you can do it on your own? Decades of research by educational psychologists has shown that when students work together in collaborative teams, they learn material better than when they sit alone at their desks. Studying as a part of a group helps you mitigate procrastination, learn faster, get new perspectives, learn new study skills, break the monotony of long periods of study, fill in learning gaps, and practice as a part of a team to get ready for the “real world”.

# Linear Regression in the Wild

![Linear Regression](/img/linear_regression.png "Linear Regression")

Linear Regression is the oldest, simple and widely used supervised machine learning algorithm for predictive analysis. It is the bread and butter of data science, so we felt we need to remind you that it’s always best to master the basics first! In this post, Yoel Zeldes talks about how he used linear regression for his data science interview home assignment. Even if you know linear regression inside out, it is still good to review this post and ensure you remember all the assumptions made, how to implement and evaluate it and how to interpret the results.

# Featured data scientist

Yoel Zeldes is an Algorithms Engineer at Taboola. Yoel is a a Machine Learning enthusiast, especially enjoying the insights of Deep Learning. Yoel started his journey in tech as a pure software engineer, and eventually moved into the position of machine learning engineer. Yoel has worked on projects related to recommender systems, cyber, computer vision, web, mobile and distributed computing. A couple of years ago, he started his own blog - http://anotherdatum.com/. He started this blog as a side project, and over time discovered his joy of writing about topics he is passionate about. The writing process also gives him the opportunity to understand the topic more deeply. Yoel believes that every data scientist should try writing their own blog - maybe they’ll also realize how fun and rewarding it can be!
