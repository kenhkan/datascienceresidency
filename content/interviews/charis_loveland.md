Hi Charis, welcome to Data Science Residency!

Q: Thank you for contributing a great post on getting into artificial intelligence. So you currently wear many hats, as an instructor, entrepreneur, and blogger. Tell us about yourself, and how you got here!

Hi Shirin, thank you for interviewing me and featuring my blog. I’m a Boston area mom who has worked in tech for over a decade. I went to Bates College in Maine, where I studied English. When I graduated, I discovered my interest in technology and changed from the technical publishing industry into program, then product, management. I received my MBA from Northeastern University with a technical focus. I’m currently working in data science consulting. 

Q: You are also the co-founder of ML Assist. Could you tell us about ML Assist, and what are your aspirations there.

This is my own company where I take on short- and medium-term projects related to my expertise in data science and business. Some recent projects include helping a towing company adopt agile methodologies and a reporting strategy for their machine learning project, writing an eBook about deep learning, teaching at [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/instructors/charis-loveland/13350), starting a newsletter about [emerging technology focused on the nonprofit sector](https://cohort3.us18.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=e82df9ca93bab66140565a478&id=9e39720475), and working for Emeritus as a teaching assistant for an [MIT course in machine learning](https://professionalonline1.mit.edu/machine-learning/index.php).

I’ve greatly enjoyed the freedom of choosing projects that appeal to my interest in learning more, educating others about technology, and broadening my expertise. I imagine I will take another product-focused corporate role in the future, but for now, I’m enjoying being my own boss.

Q: You served as a product manager in your last corporate role. What does it mean to be a product manager to you, and what skills does it require? Do you also need any technical skills?

To me, a product manager is an extension of and an advocate for the customer. A product manager need to be data-driven, collaborative, and possess solid business acumen. Knowledge of frameworks like agile and design thinking also helps. I think technical skills are critical for a product manager. It’s another tool in their toolkit. I’m investing in my technical education through some of the resources I mentioned in [my blog](https://charismama.blogspot.com/2018/12/how-do-you-get-into-artificial.html). [*Inspired*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3323374-inspired) is my favorite book about product management.

Q: As a product manager, do you also work with data, to derive insights and inform decisions?

Absolutely. When thinking about a possible data science project to take on, I develop a business case for the project based on a similar past project. If no baseline exists, I make sound assumptions based on the type of enhancement I want to make. A good product idea may come from a customer interview. For example, a company may want to enhance its website with personalization. If they performed another type of personalization in a past project, they can look at the percentage that project increased revenue for the company and make a similar prediction for the new feature. Then, test the feature by offering the control group the same experience and the test group the new one, and see how sales and other relevant KPIs like engagement compare in the A/B test.

Q: As a product manager, what teams do you mostly work with and in what capacity?

I’m happiest working with engineers. I consider myself their advocate and voice with business stakeholders. I generally serve as a product owner on a scrum team. I also work with product and marketing peers and executives to present product enhancement ideas and refine roadmaps.

Q: Do you see product management as an option for aspiring or current data scientists to consider?

I think if you truly love working with and modeling data, you should stick with that. But if you enjoy working with people, product management may be for you. Personally, I love collaborating and explaining complex ideas to others, including customers and stakeholders. I spend a lot of time thinking about abstract ideas and what is possible.

Q: As a product manager, you work very closely with both engineering and data science teams. What are the challenges in your role in interaction with these teams?

In data science, education of approaches to business stakeholders without a lot of time to consume complex technical information can be challenging. Additionally, sometimes engineers disagree on the best way to implement a solution. I think my role as a product manager is to advocate for the customer to get a good solution efficiently rather than a perfect solution in an unreasonable time frame. I stand by the saying that done is better than perfect.

Q: You have the experience of being both a program manager and product manager at lead tech companies. How are these roles different? What skills do they share in common? Which one do you like most?

Though definitions vary from company to company, product managers are different from project or program managers in that they focus less on daily schedules and day to day execution and more on metrics, roadmaps, and testing data-driven insights. As a traditional program manager, I was much more concerned with the integration of my team with product, engineering, sales, and marketing, and keeping everyone informed and on track. A good program manager is very detail oriented, and this can help product managers, too. I prefer product management because I enjoy spending time thinking about the best way to meet customer needs.

Q: As a woman in technology, what do you suggest for those who don’t have a computer science or engineering background, but are aspiring to be in tech?

Get out there and learn! I willed myself from publishing into tech by leveraging the information I’d learned and connections I made, and have learned a new discipline with each role. Seek out peers and mentors who can help guide your way. Attend lots of networking events and invest in your education, such as a professional degree, bootcamp, or online open classes. Learn about imposter syndrome and work on your self-esteem and confidence.

Q: What are your career aspirations? (where do you want to be in 5 years?)

I have never set out to hold a specific title or office. I have relied on saying yes to interesting, challenging work with smart people. So I expect I will keep taking that approach!

Q: Are there any resources you’d recommend to get started with machine learning?

There is so much out there, but I’ve started a list in [this blog](https://charismama.blogspot.com/2018/12/how-do-you-get-into-artificial.html). Please comment with your favorite resources.
