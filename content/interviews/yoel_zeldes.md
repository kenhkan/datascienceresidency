Hi Yoel, welcome to Data Science Residency!
 
Q: Thank you Yoel for contributing a great post on regression. So you are an algorithm engineer at Taboola. Tell us about yourself, and how you got here!

I started my career as a pure software engineer. I got my hands dirty in many technical domains – including low level, distributed systems and front end. One thing bothered me though – in most software engineering tasks it’s known that the goal will be achieved. It’s going to be challenging, but it will happen. So I decided to make a transition into a domain where the solution is unknown in advance. I found myself in the machine learning (ML) domain, and I couldn’t be happier. I think nowadays ML is a core part of many products/companies, and the entry barrier is lower than ever. Therefore, if you find it interesting, you should make the transition too!
 
Q: As an algorithm engineer, what type of data do you work with, and how do you get this data? What types of tools do you use?

It really depends on the company you work for. At Taboola, where we’re developing a content recommendation system, our challenge is to match content to readers. We’ve collected the data through the usage of our product. It contains categorical features, numerical features, text and images of the items we want to recommend, and more. It’s really interesting to work with all these different types of data, and one solution that worked really well for us is deep learning. In the last couple of years we transitioned all of our stack to deep learning, specifically TensorFlow. We also use all kinds of big data tools such as Spark, Kafka, Cassandra and BigQuery.

Q: What is the best/worst part of your job?

Content recommendations is a messy challenge. There are so many moving parts – ones you won’t see in the academic world. There are two sides to that: it’s really interesting to see how to solve a real world problem, where the solution is composed of both ML and engineering sub-solutions; however, it can also be frustrating to not understand why your latest model isn’t winning, just to realize it’s because of some other non-ML moving part you didn’t account for.
 
Q: data career paths, what do you suggest for those who don’t have a computer science background, but are aspiring to enter this field?

Today it’s really easy to get the knowledge – there are plenty of free online courses. The real challenge, however, is to get the experience. I think it’s crucial to create your own side project that shows what knowledge you gained. If the project is personal – even better. It shows to potential employers that you’re passionate about the field. I had this experience myself, where I wanted to learn how to develop mobile apps. On my free time I developed my personal app – CapoeiraTunes (Capoeira is something I love to do). Even though I did have experience as a software engineer, this app came up in most of the interviews I had – it really made an impact.
 
Q: what are your career aspirations? (where do you want to be in 5 years?)

I really enjoy ML. However, without having a real problem to solve, this tool belt is useless. This is why I want to get even more experience in applied ML, where you have both the opportunity to advance state of the art, and the opportunity to have a real impact on people’s lives via valuable products you can create.
